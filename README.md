Edit the two CSV files to assign research groups to areas in SCI (feel free to comment if I've done something silly).

Check the [interactive map](https://alex-r-bigelow.github.io/scix-map/) to make sure it worked.

TODO: Once assignments have settled down a little, I should add a custom color map (e.g. InfoVis = shades of yellow, Imaging = shades of blue, etc) with a legend.
